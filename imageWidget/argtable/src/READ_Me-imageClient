If you will have such problems as
  argtable.obj: error LNK2001: unresolved external simbol _optopt

you should  go to src dir and exec:
  nmake -f Makefile.nmake
  Then copy the argtable2.h, argtable2.lib, argtable2.dll, impargtable2.lib to Win dir


IF you will have some another trouble visit http://argtable.sourceforge.net/
